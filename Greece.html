    <h3> An acropolis was the settlement of an upper part of an ancient Greek city, especially a citadel, and frequently
        a hill with precipitous sides, mainly chosen for purposes of defense. The term is typically used to refer to the
        Acropolis of Athens, yet every Greek city had an acropolis of its own. Acropoloi were used as religious centers
        and places of worship, forts, and places in which the royal and high-status resided. Acropolises became the
        nuclei of large cities of classical ancient times, and served as important centers of a community. Some
        well-known acropoloi have become the centers of tourism in present-day, and, especially, the Acropolis of Athens
        has been a revolutionary center for the studies of ancient Greece since the Mycenaean period. Many of them have
        become a source of revenue for Greece, and represent some great technology during the period. An acropolis is
        defined by the Greek definition of ἀκρόπολις, akropolis; from akros (άκρος) or akron (άκρον) meaning “highest;
        edge; extremity”, and polis (πόλις) meaning “city.” The plural of acropolis (ακρόπολη) is acropolises, also
        commonly as acropoleis and acropoles, and ακροπόλεις in Greek. This word was first used in the 14th century BCE,
        in the context of Mycenaean kings and community. The term acropolis is also used to describe the central complex
        of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many Maya cities, including Tikal and Copán.
        Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban Castro culture settlements
        located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops. It is primarily associated with the Greek cities of Athens, Argos
        (with Larisa), Thebes (with Cadmea), Corinth (with its Acrocorinth), and Rhodes (with its Acropolis of Lindos.
        It may also be applied generically to all such citadels including Rome, Carthage, Jerusalem, Celtic Bratislava,
        Asia Minor, or Castle Rock in Edinburgh. An example in Ireland is the Rock of Cashel. In Central Italy, many
        small rural communes still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as rocca of the commune. Other
        parts of the world have developed other names for the high citadel, or alcázar, which often have reinforced a
        naturally strong site. Because of this, many cultures have included acropolises in their societies, however, do
        not use the same name for them. Here, at the Acropolis, we can also find the temple of Aphrodite - goddess of
        beauty and love, the temple of Hephaistos - the "steel maker" fo the gods. He made all kind of weapons and
        "gadgets" for the gods, including Zeus's thunderbolt. A most recent building is an old, small church from the
        early 1200's</h3>

        The Parthenon; Ancient Greek: Παρθενών, Parthenṓn, [par.tʰe.nɔ̌ːn]; Greek: Παρθενώνας, Parthenónas,
        [parθeˈnonas]) is a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, that was dedicated to the goddess Athena
        during the fifth century BC. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art, an
        enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, democracy and Western civilization.
        The Parthenon was built in thanksgiving for the Hellenic victory over Persian invaders during the Greco-Persian
        Wars. Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon also served as the city treasury.
        Construction started in 447 BC when the Delian League was at the peak of its power. It was completed in 438;
        work on the decoration continued until 432. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which
        later became the Athenian Empire. In the final decade of the 6th century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a
        Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After the Ottoman conquest in the mid-fifteenth century, it
        became a mosque. In the Morean War, a Venetian bomb landed on the Parthenon, which the Ottomans had used as a
        munitions dump, during the 1687 siege of the Acropolis. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon.
        From 1800 to 1803, the 7th Earl of Elgin took down some of the surviving sculptures, now known as the Elgin
        Marbles, in an act widely considered, both in its time and subsequently, to constitute vandalism and looting.
        The Parthenon replaced an older temple of Athena, which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon,
        that was demolished in the Persian invasion of 480 BC.
        Since 1975, numerous large-scale restoration projects have been undertaken to preserve remaining artefacts and
        ensure its structural integrity.
        Ancient Greece (Greek: Ἑλλάς, romanized: Hellás) was a northeastern Mediterranean civilization, existing from
        the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th–9th centuries BC to the end of classical antiquity (c. AD 600), that comprised a
        loose collection of culturally and linguistically related city-states and other territories. Most of these
        regions were officially unified only once, for 13 years, under Alexander the Great's empire from 336 to 323 BC
        (though this excludes a number of Greek city-states free from Alexander's jurisdiction in the western
        Mediterranean, around the Black Sea, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica). In Western history, the era of classical antiquity
        was immediately followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period.
        Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form
        in the 8th century BC, ushering in the Archaic period and the colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was
        followed by the age of Classical Greece, from the Greco-Persian Wars to the 5th to 4th centuries BC, and which
        included the Golden Age of Athens. The conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon spread Hellenistic
        civilization from the western Mediterranean to Central Asia. The Hellenistic period ended with the conquest of
        the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, and the annexation of the Roman province of Macedonia in
        Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.
        Classical Greek culture, especially philosophy, had a powerful influence on ancient Rome, which carried a
        version of it throughout the Mediterranean and much of Europe. For this reason, Classical Greece is generally
        considered the cradle of Western civilization, the seminal culture from which the modern West derives many of
        its founding archetypes and ideas in politics, philosophy, science, and art.
