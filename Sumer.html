    <h3>Sumer is the earliest known civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia (south-central Iraq),
        emerging during the Chalcolithic and early Bronze Ages between the sixth and fifth millennium BC. It is one of
        the cradles of civilization in the world, along with ancient Egypt, Elam, the Caral-Supe civilization,
        Mesoamerica, the Indus Valley civilisation, and ancient China. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and
        Euphrates rivers, Sumerian farmers grew an abundance of grain and other crops, the surplus from which enabled
        them to form urban settlements. Proto-writing dates back before 3000 BC. The earliest texts come from the cities
        of Uruk and Jemdet Nasr, and date to between c. 3500 and c. 3000 BC. This ancient civilisation is usually
        associated with the myth of Annunaki, an alien species that descended on Earth from the planet “Nibir/Nibiru”.
        Why alien? Because acording to some clay tablets found relatively recent, they tell the story of these "Gods"
        Annunaki that descended from "heavens", onto Earth, and started to live with the people but they rather enslaved
        them, more that teaching them.

    <h3>The Anunnaki (Sumerian: 𒀭𒀀𒉣𒈾), also transcribed as Anunaki, Annunaki, Anunna, Ananaki and other variations)
        are a group of deities of the ancient Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians. In the earliest Sumerian
        writings about them, which come from the Post-Akkadian period, the Anunnaki are deities in the pantheon,
        descendants of An and Ki, the god of the heavens and the goddess of earth, and their primary function was to
        decree the fates of humanity.
        The name Anunnaki is derived from An, the Sumerian god of the sky. The name is variously written "a-nuna",
        a-nuna-ke-ne", or a-nun-na", meaning "princely offspring" or "offspring of An".
        The Anunnaki were believed to be the offspring of An and his consort, the earth goddess Ki. Samuel Noah Kramer
        identifies Ki with the Sumerian mother goddess Ninhursag, stating that they were originally the same figure. The
        oldest of the Anunnaki was Enlil, the god of air and chief god of the Sumerian pantheon. The Sumerians believed
        that, until Enlil was born, heaven and earth were inseparable. Then, Enlil cleft heaven and earth in two and
        carried away the earth while his father An carried away the sky. The picture below resembles Ur (/ʊər/;
        Sumerian: 𒌶𒆠, 𒋀𒀕𒆠, or 𒋀𒀊𒆠[1] Urim; Akkadian: 𒋀𒀕𒆠 Uru;[3] Arabic: أُوْر, romanized: ʾūr; Hebrew: אוּר,
        romanized: ʾūr) was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell
        el-Muqayyar (Arabic: تل ٱلْمُقَيَّر) in south Iraq's Dhi Qar Governorate in the Arabian Peninsula.[4] Although
        Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and
        the city is now well inland, on the south bank of the Euphrates, 16 kilometres (9.9 miles) from Nasiriyah in
        modern-day Iraq. The city dates from the Ubaid period circa 3800 BC, and is recorded in written history as a
        city-state from the 26th century BC, its first recorded king being Mesannepada.
        The city's patron deity was Nanna (in Akkadian, Sin), the Sumerian and Akkadian moon god, and the name of the
        city is in origin derived from the god's name, UNUGKI, literally "the abode (UNUG) of Nanna". The site is marked
        by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur, which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the
        1930s. The temple was built in the 21st century BC (short chronology), during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was
        reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon.

    <h3>It is believed that the sumerians actually wore the first of the civilisations, that invented writing. Cuneiform
        script/writing was done on clay tablets, with appropriate tools. The cuneiform script was developed from
        pictographic proto-writing in the late 4th millennium BC, stemming from the near eastern token system used for
        accounting. The meaning and usage of these tokens is still a matter of debate. These tokens were in use from the
        9th millennium BC and remained in occasional use even late in the 2nd millennium BC. Early tokens with
        pictographic shapes of animals, associated with numbers, were discovered in Tell Brak, and date to the mid-4th
        millennium BC. It has been suggested that the token shapes were the original basis for some of the Sumerian
        pictographs.
        Cuneiform is a logo-syllabic script that was used to write several languages of the Ancient Middle East. The
        script was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era. It is named for the
        characteristic wedge-shaped impressions (Latin: cuneus) which form its signs. Cuneiform was originally developed
        to write the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Cuneiform is the earliest known writing
        system.
        Over the course of its history, cuneiform was adapted to write a number of languages in addition to Sumerian.
        Akkadian texts are attested from the 24th century BC onward and make up the bulk of the cuneiform record.
        Akkadian cuneiform was itself adapted to write the Hittite language in the early second millennium BC. The other
        languages with significant cuneiform corpora are Eblaite, Elamite, Hurrian, Luwian, and Urartian. The Old
        Persian and Ugaritic alphabets feature cuneiform-style signs; however, they are unrelated to the cuneiform
        logo-syllabary proper.
        The latest known cuneiform tablet dates to 75 AD. The script fell totally out of use soon after and was
        forgotten until its rediscovery and decipherment in the 19th century. The study of cuneiform belongs to the
        field of Assyriology. An estimated half a million tablets are held in museums across the world, but
        comparatively few of these are published. The largest collections belong to the British Museum (approx. 130,000
        tablets), the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin, the Louvre, the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, the National Museum
        of Iraq, the Yale Babylonian Collection (approx. 40,000 tablets), and Penn Museum.
