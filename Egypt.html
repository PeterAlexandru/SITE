    <h3>The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak. Temple’s name derived from the Arabic work “ Khurnaq “ – “
        fortified village “. The Karnak complex, situated in the general area of Egypt – Luxor, comprises a vast mix of
        decayed temples, pylons, chapels and some other buildings. Construction at the complex began during the reign of
        Senusret I (reigned 1971–1926 BCE) in the Middle Kingdom (around 2000–1700 BCE) and continued into the Ptolemaic
        Kingdom (305–30 BCE), although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak
        was the ancient Egyptian “Ipet-isut” ("The Most Selected of Places") and the main place of worship of the 18th
        Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and in 1979
        it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city. The Karnak complex gives its
        name to the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of
        Luxor.</h3></div>

    <h3>Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples in the village of Abu Simbel (Arabic: أبو
        سمبل), Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. It is situated on the western bank of Lake
        Nasser, about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road). The twin temples were
        originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh
        Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting monument to the king Ramesses II. His wife Nefertari and children can be
        seen in smaller figures by his feet, considered to be of lesser importance and were not given the same position
        of scale. This commemorates his victory at the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external rock relief figures have
        become iconic.
        The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 as part of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of
        Nubia, under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz Michałowski, from the Polish Centre of
        Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above
        the Aswan High Dam reservoir. The relocation of the temples – together with other temples which run from Abu
        Simbel downriver to Philae including Amada, Wadi es-Sebua, and other Nubian sites – was necessary or they would
        have been submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the
        building of the Aswan High Dam on the River Nile. The Abu Simbel complex, and the other relocated temples, are
        part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments".

    <h3>The Giza pyramid complex (Arabic: مجمع أهرامات الجيزة), also called the Giza necropolis, is the site on the Giza
        Plateau in Greater Cairo, Egypt that includes the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid
        of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx of Giza. All were built during
        the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between 2600 and 2500 BC. The site also includes several
        cemeteries and the remains of a workers' village.
        The site is at the edges of the Western Desert, approximately 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in
        the city of Giza, and about 13 kilometres (8 mi) southwest of the city centre of Cairo. Along with nearby
        Memphis, the site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.
        The Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they have
        historically been common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They were popularised in
        Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the
        World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.
        The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu and
        constructed c. 2580 – c. 2560 BC), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren) a few hundred metres to
        the south-west, and the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinos) a few hundred metres farther
        south-west. The Great Sphinx lies on the east side of the complex. Current consensus among Egyptologists is that
        the head of the Great Sphinx is that of Khafre. Along with these major monuments are a number of smaller
        satellite edifices, known as "queens" pyramids, causeways and valley pyramids.
