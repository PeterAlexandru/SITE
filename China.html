    <h3>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng,
        literally "ten thousand li wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern
        borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
        Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later
        joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many
        successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the
        wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
        Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of
        duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of
        immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the
        construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of
        smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
        The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong
        in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe)
        in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km
        (13,170.70 mi) in total. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the
        most impressive architectural feats in history.

    <h4>The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first
        emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of
        protecting the emperor in his afterlife.
        The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in
        Lintong County, outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. The figures vary in height according to their roles, the tallest
        being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that the three
        pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry
        horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. Other terracotta
        non-military figures were found in other pits, including officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians. The
        construction of the tomb was described by historian Sima Qian (145–90 BCE) in Records of the Grand Historian,
        the first of China's 24 dynastic histories, which was written a century after the mausoleum's completion. Work
        on the mausoleum began in 246 BCE soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) ascended the throne, and the project
        eventually involved 700,000 conscripted workers. Geographer Li Daoyuan, writing six centuries after the first
        emperor's death, recorded in Shui Jing Zhu that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology:
        "famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the
        first emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there". Sima Qian wrote that the
        first emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects. According to
        this account, 100 flowing rivers were simulated using mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with
        heavenly bodies, below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to "models"
        or "imitations"; however, those words were not used in the original text, which makes no mention of the
        terracotta army. High levels of mercury were found in the soil of the tomb mound, giving credence to Sima Qian's
        account. Later historical accounts suggested that the complex and tomb itself had been looted by Xiang Yu, a
        contender for the throne after the death of the first emperor. However, there are indications that the tomb
        itself may not have been plundered. The Terracotta Army was discovered on 29 March 1974 by a group of
        farmers—Yang Zhifa, his five brothers, and neighbour Wang Puzhi—who were digging a well approximately 1.5
        kilometres (0.93 mi) east of the Qin Emperor's tomb mound at Mount Li (Lishan), a region riddled with
        underground springs and watercourses. For centuries, occasional reports mentioned pieces of terracotta figures
        and fragments of the Qin necropolis – roofing tiles, bricks and chunks of masonry. This discovery prompted
        Chinese archaeologists, including Zhao Kangmin, to investigate, revealing the largest pottery figurine group
        ever found. A museum complex has since been constructed over the area, the largest pit being enclosed by a
        roofed structure.
        The Terracotta Army is part of a much larger necropolis. Ground-penetrating radar and core sampling have
        measured the area to be approximately 98 square kilometers (38 square miles).
